# **Assignment 2: Calculator**

## **Overview**  
In this assignment, your task is to create a calculator application that performs basic arithmetic operations.

## **Objectives**  
Enhance your understanding of React components, hooks (`useState` and `useEffect`), buttons, and input fields by building a functional calculator. You'll practice managing state, performing arithmetic operations, and styling your application.

## **Tasks**

### **1. Create a New React Application:**
- Set up a new React application using Vite.

### **2. Import and Modify `Calculate.jsx`:**
- Copy the provided `Calculate.jsx` file into a new folder and import it into `App.jsx`.
- Modify the `Calculate.jsx` file to add functionality for subtraction, multiplication, and division, as addition is already included.

### **3. Add Input Fields and Buttons:**
- Include two input fields in the component to allow users to enter numbers.
- Add four buttons for the basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Display the result of the selected operation on the page.

### **4. Manage State with Hooks:**
- Use the `useState` hook to manage the state variables for the input numbers and the result.
- Use the `useEffect` hook to display results in the console.

### **5. Styling:**
- Add CSS to style the input fields and buttons in `App.css`.
- Ensure the layout is user-friendly and visually appealing.

### **6. Update `App.jsx`:**
- Change and add `<h1>` tag in `App.jsx` to display the following texts:
  - COSC ReactJS and FastAPI Bootcamp
  - Roll Number: (Followed by your roll number)
  - Assignment 2: Calculator
